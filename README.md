# Rodrigo Dadam - Portfolio WebSite

[You can see the MVP website here](https://rodrigodadam.github.io/PP1/)

This website was created to complete the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. However, I will consider this an MVP for my professional Portfolio and a marketing website where I can share my services. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate whether on your computer, tablet or mobile. Also, the Project has a Product Backlog and I will follow some Agile Principles.

For example: This website helps me to show my skills and some projects I have worked on for clients. The site will be updated in the future, with more features and also with more services, " I will only show services that customers have given proper authorization ". This portfolio will be useful to people who are looking for the services that I provide. And have some difficulties in finding professionals to work on their projects.

## Design

- __Color Scheme__

  - The three main colours used are Black #000000, White #FFFFFF and a tone of orange/red #F26934.

- __Typography__

  - The Main font used throughout this website is [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins#glyphs) family because this font is clean and professional font.
  - The Logo font used is [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico) family. This font refers to a typology that is very reminiscent of a signature, for this reason it was chosen to be used in the website logo.
