# Rodrigo Dadam - Portfolio WebSite

[You can see the MVP website here](https://rodrigodadam.github.io/PP1/)


This website was created for professional purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. However also I'll consider this a MVP for my professional Portfolio and a marketing website where I can share my services. It is designed to be responsibe and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate whether on your computer, tablet or mobile. Also the Project has a Product Backlog and I'll follow some Agile Principles.
